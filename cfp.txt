Call for Participation:
TextGraphs-13 Shared Task on Explanation Regeneration
https://github.com/umanlp/tg2019task

We invite participation in the new shared task on explanation regeneration
associated with the 13th Workshop on Graph-Based Natural Language Processing
(TextGraphs 2019).

Overview
========

This shared task focuses on explanation reconstruction, a stepping-stone
towards general multi-hop inference over language. In particular, the inputs
to this task consist of questions and their correct answers. Participating
systems must extract and rank explanation sentences from a provided
unstructured knowledge base such that the top-ranked sentences provide
a complete explanation for the given answer.

Example
=======

For example, for the question: "Which of the following is an example of an
organism taking in nutrients?" with the correct answer: "a girl eating an
apple", an ideal system would rank the following explanatory statements
at the top of its extracted sentences:

1. A girl means a human girl.
2. Humans are living organisms.
3. Eating is when an organism takes in nutrients in the form of food.
4. Fruits are kinds of foods.
5. An apple is a kind of fruit.
